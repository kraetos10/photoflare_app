        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Multi Server lets you add as many PhotoPrism servers as you need — a home NAS, a cloud VPS, a family server — and manage them all from a single app. Each server keeps its own credentials and connection settings, so switching between them is instant.</p>
        <p>Add a new server from the settings screen, give it a name and colour, and you're ready to go. Photoflare remembers your session for each server, so you won't need to re-authenticate every time you switch.</p>

        <h2>Unified Library</h2>
        <p>With multiple servers connected, you can browse photos from all of them in a single, unified library view. No need to switch back and forth — everything appears together in one timeline.</p>
        <p>When you want to focus on a single server, open the server filter menu to narrow your view. The filter is always one tap away, making it easy to jump between your unified library and individual servers.</p>

        <h2>Server Management</h2>
        <p>Each server can be customised with a name and colour, making it easy to tell them apart at a glance. The colour appears throughout the app — in the server list, the filter menu, and alongside photos in the unified view.</p>
        <p>Connection details, authentication, and upload settings are configured independently per server, giving you full control over how Photoflare interacts with each one.</p>
